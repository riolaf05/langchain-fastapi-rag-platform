"""
This file will contain the business logic for text cleaning.

It will house functions responsible for processing and cleaning text data used in the summarization process.

Some potential functionalities include:

- Text normalization (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing special characters)
- Removing stop words (common words that don't contribute much meaning)
- Applying stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form)
- Custom cleaning rules specific to your domain

These functions will likely be used by the cleaning_router.py to implement the API endpoints.
