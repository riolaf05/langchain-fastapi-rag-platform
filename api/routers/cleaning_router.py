"""
This file is a placeholder for the cleaning API router.

It will handle API endpoints related to text cleaning functionalities within the summarization pipeline.

Once implemented, this router will likely define functions to:

- Receive messages from the message queue (similar to summarization_router.py).
- Extract text from messages (if necessary).
- Apply cleaning logic to the text (e.g., removing noise, punctuation, stop words).
- Send the cleaned text to the next stage in the pipeline (e.g., summarization).
