"""
This file is intended to define dependency injection logic for the project.

Here, you can centralize the configuration and creation of database connections, external services, or any other reusable resources that your application relies on.

By using dependency injection, you can improve code testability and maintainability.

**Example Usage:**

from fastapi import Depends

async def some_function(db: Database = Depends(get_database)):
    # Use the injected database object here
    pass
