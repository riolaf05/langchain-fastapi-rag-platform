The most notable among these were R ecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-T erm Memory (LSTMs), and Gated R ecurrent Units (GRUs). Although these models made significant contribution towards AI research, they also had limitations that prevented them achieve certain performance metrics. AI world needed a \"game changer\" which came in the form of a state-of-the- art Transformer  architecture proposed in the The 2017 paper “ Attention is All Y ou Need ”  Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf The paper was published in 2017 by V aswani et al. It introduced the T ransformer model, which revolutionized  01/02/24, 15:00 (25) A Quick Summary of Research Papers regarding Generative AI | LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-summary-research-papers-regarding-generative-ai-soumava-dey/ 3/7natural language processing (NLP) by replacing traditional recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms. The Transformer model utilizes self-attention to capture relationships between words in a sentence, enabling parallel processing and improving performance on various NLP tasks such as machine translation. The paper demonstrated that T ransformers achieved state-of-the-art results while being more computationally efficient than previous models. Since its publication, the T ransformer architecture has become the foundation for many subsequent advancements in NLP.  2. Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models: The paper  Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models  contains a study of empirical scaling laws for\\xa0language model performance on the cross-entropy loss, focusing on the\\xa0T ransformer\\xa0architecture. The related research yielded that larger models are significantly more sample efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.
